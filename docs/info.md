# How it works

# 2-bit Magnitude Comparator

**Author:** BMSCE

## Project Description
- This project implements a **2-bit magnitude comparator** in Verilog for the Tiny Tapeout platform.  
- It compares two unsigned 2-bit numbers (A and B) and produces three outputs indicating whether:
    - **A > B**, **A = B**, or **A < B**.  
- The design uses simple Boolean logic with assign statements, making it lightweight and suitable for synthesis and tapeout.

## Logic Implementation

Let `A = A1 A0` and `B = B1 B0`:

## Logic Implementation

### Equality (A = B)
```verilog
assign uo_out[1] = (~(A1 ^ B1)) & (~(A0 ^ B0));


Both bits must match for the equality output to be high.

-**Greater Than (A > B):**
```verilog
 assign uo_out[0] = (A1 & ~B1) | ((~(A1 ^ B1)) & (A0 & ~B0));

If the MSB of A is greater than B, or if MSBs are equal and LSB of A > LSB of B, output is high.
```

-**Less Than (A < B):** 
```verilog
assign uo_out[2] = (~A1 & B1) | ((~(A1 ^ B1)) & (~A0 & B0));

```

| Pin          | Function           |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| `ui_in[1:0]` | Input A (2-bit)    |
| `ui_in[3:2]` | Input B (2-bit)    |
| `uo_out[0]`  | A > B              |
| `uo_out[1]`  | A = B              |
| `uo_out[2]`  | A < B              |
| Other pins   | Unused / tied to 0 |
Bidirectional pins (uio_in, uio_out, uio_oe) are not used in this project.


# How to test

- Simulation:
 - The design was verified with a simple Verilog testbench covering all input combinations.
